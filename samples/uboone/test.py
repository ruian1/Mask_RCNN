# # Mask R-CNN - Train on Shapes Dataset
# 
# 
# This notebook shows how to train Mask R-CNN on your own dataset. To keep things simple we use a synthetic dataset of shapes (squares, triangles, and circles) which enables fast training. You'd still need a GPU, though, because the network backbone is a Resnet101, which would be too slow to train on a CPU. On a GPU, you can start to get okay-ish results in a few minutes, and good results in less than an hour.
# 
# The code of the *Shapes* dataset is included below. It generates images on the fly, so it doesn't require downloading any data. And it can generate images of any size, so we pick a small image size to train faster.

# 
# 2. Fine-tune all layers. For this simple example it's not necessary, but we're including it to show the process. Simply pass `layers="all` to train all layers.
